CRITICAL: Before starting ANY task, you MUST complete these steps.

1. READ every file in `.agent/rules/`. Treat each rule as a CRITICAL: instruction that MUST be followed.

2. Your available skills are listed in your system prompt under "Available skills". For each skill whose description matches your current task, you MUST `view_file` its SKILL.md (path shown next to each skill name) and apply its guidance. Do this in the same batch as reading rules — do not defer it.

3. NEVER skip these steps. If you find yourself about to start coding without having read the rules and scanned skills, STOP and complete this checklist first.
